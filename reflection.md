## Reflection

This lab reinforced my understanding of web application security
and how automated scanning tools like OWASP ZAP are used in penetration
testing.

Challenges faced:
- Interpreting scan results and distinguishing false positives
- Configuring the browser proxy for effective scanning

Key takeaways:
- Automated tools are crucial for efficiency but require human analysis
- Security misconfigurations are a common source of risk
- Ethical authorization and safe lab environments are mandatory
